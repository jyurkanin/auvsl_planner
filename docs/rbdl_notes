!!! Pls read this to make sure you do transformations correct !!!


the function Quaternion::toMatrix()
DOes not do what you would expect.
Instead it returns the transpose of the corresponding rotation
matrix. This took a while to figure out and caused much suffering.

    

RBDL defines a spatial transform from FRAME A to FRAME B as:
        X = {vec3 r, mat3x3 E}

There is a significant difference between displacement and
transform, although they are used almost interchangeably.
    
X.r is a pure translation that defines the displacement from
origin of A to origin of B

it is NOT the coordinate transform that expresses a vector v_A
in coordinate frame A into frame B

it represents the displacement from origin A to origin B


X.E works the opposite.
let R be the rotational displacement that rotates a coordinate
frame A to frame B.

X.E is the rotational displacement that express a vector v_A
(defined in frame A) in frame B.


See spatial transform cheat sheet.
Note that this is for the spatial v2 library.
Which expresses a transform X as a 6x6 and not as a pair (E,r)
