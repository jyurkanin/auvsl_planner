Source Files:
1. auvsl_planner_node.cpp
  This contains the actual node that performs local and global path planning.
  It contains instances of the a global and local path planner.
  This is where all the ROS interactions take place.

2. DirectedVehicleControlSampler.cpp
  This class is for OMPL. It implements the DirectedControlSampler base class
  and it is used within the RRT algorithm to sample controls and build the
  search tree.

3. GlobalParams.cpp
  Contains the GlobalParams class. This has all static members and it just
  reads from the config/params.yaml file all the configuration parameters set
  in there. The class just allows a global way to access these without calling
  the ROS functions everytime.

4. JackalDynamicSolver.cpp
  This contains the vehicle forward dynamics code (solved with RBDL).
  It also contains some a newton-euler integration scheme for simulation.
  The Bekker Terrain-Tire model is also in this file in the form of a neural net.

5. JackalStatePropagator.cpp
  This class is really just a wrapper around the JackalDynamicSolver that makes
  the solver compatible with the OMPL library. This class also has the
  get_waypoints function which is useful for obtaining the waypoints of a
  computed path plan.

6. LocalPlanner.cpp
  This is going to contain an abtract base class LocalPlanner thats all.

7. PlannerVisualizer.cpp
  This was a utility that works with the global planner to visualize the
  search tree. Its very simple and uses X11 drawing routines for graphics.

8. RRTGlobalPlanner.cpp
  This contains the RRT global planner.
  Constructor takes a TerrainMap and calling plan will search for a path between
  the start and end points.

9. TerrainMap.cpp
  Abstract base class containing terrain map.
  Also a simple terrainMap using rectangular obstacles. THis is a place holder
  for a more advanced terrain map.

10. test_planner_node.cpp
  Just a file for messing around and creating any kind of tests that I can think
  of for the global planner

11. test_steerability_node.cpp
  This runs a test for the heuristic that I implemented in the RRT planner.

12. utils.cpp
  Whatever utility functions I think I'll need across multiple files.

13. VehicleControlSampler.cpp
  I ended up not really using this file. All it does is sample a random control.
  It works within the RRT algorithm but it is not really used. DirectedVehicleControlSampler
  is used instead.

14. VehicleRRT.cpp
  This is mainly a copy and paste from the OMPL RRT implementation.
  I added a few tweaks/heuristics to make it work a bit better for vehicles.

15. VehicleStateProjections.cpp
  This is a complete copy and paste job from OMPL. I don't think I made
  any changes to this file except for the class name. It was originally
  RealVectorStateProjections.cpp I think.

16. VehicleStateSpace.cpp
  This is mostly copy and paste from OMPL RealVectorStateSpace.cpp. I copy
  and pasted it because I wanted to modify the distance function. I modified
  the distance function to make it more suitable for vehicles. Basically, all I
  did was I made distance between vehicle states only depend on x and y distance.
  There are additional heuristics for distance based on velocity that can be
  enabled in the config/params.yaml file. However, modification can break the
  metric space property of the state space which I believe is a necessary condition
  for some path planners in OMPL (Not RRT though).
